# ImageFiltering

Menu Driven Image Filtering Program 

I was required to build a menu driven program which read in an Input Image and presented the user with various Filter options to apply to the image.
The user is prompted to enter a file name to save the new filtered image and is also presented with an option to enter the file path of the chosen image which the selected filter 
will be applied too.

Example Images:
